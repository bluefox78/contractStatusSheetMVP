Completed:
- able to show the month and hours from the current month

Pending Work:
- need to show the next 12 months. Somewhere in the "combineMonthContractHour" 
needs to have the function that enables the showing of the next 12 months and that 
there's 0 hours. 
-- what if we change the array of months into object? this way, we can use .find or .merge? 
-- but how do we change the array of months into object by adding 0 hours to it to display 
the month:hour object?
